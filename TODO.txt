Green is too bight.
Font is ok, It's sans serif (passable)
Buttons are way to wide. I would have made them just wide enough that they need to be.
Just a little bit wider than the text.
No footer.
Menu at top is too close to the logo.
Centred font is garbage on more than one line.  Make it Justified or left/right only.

About us is empty. Apart from one shitty button placement for a tutorial.

Tutorial is too long and way to animated, Just make it a 1 page, with panels for each area, no animation.
Users actually hate transitions. Impatience.

Home is just the tutorial.! Shite!
