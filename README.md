# Opinionated
## Aim
Opinionated aims to let New Zealanders vote on the problems we feel like we should talk about. It brings issues we think need to be talked about into the spotlight and lets us directly vote on them.

## How can I help?
Right now Opinionated is still in the development phase. Check back later for updates!

## Why is this on GitHub?
Being such a sensitive topic of the votes of New Zealanders on subjects, we don't want the power to be able to change the results we get. Because of this the Opinionated website is OPEN SOURCE so you can see everything that happens to make sure Opinionated stays fair.
